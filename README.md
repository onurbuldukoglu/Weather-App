# Weather App

### [Live App](https://onurbuldukoglu.github.io/Weather-App/)

This is a simple web application that serves the weather information on a location that the user searches for. The app uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)'s API for the data.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used in the app. DOM elements are created through JavaScript functions.
